Welcome to "What's for Dinner!" menu generator by ChefWare.
Enter how many days of menus you want generated and Whats for Dinner!
will generate them. From that starting point regenerate individual dishes 
or entire themes until you get what you want.
Then the program will export your menu to a spreadsheet where you can save it
and print it.
The program loads a .json database (if you have a previously saved one) otherwise
it will create one for you and you can begin populating it with your own dishes.
NOTE: To make your own .json database use my other program whats_for_dinner_database_maker here: https://github.com/RLalor/buffet_generator_database_maker

TECHNICAL NOTES: 
Breakfasts and Desserts are not themed.
The "Generic" theme houses these 2 categories as well as other normal unthemed dishes
like steak, BBQ wings, Garden salad, Steamed veg, etc.
To change entire lunch/dinner themes select Theme (indices 2).
Scroll right to see all columns of the tables.

COMMANDS:
Commands used here are mostly yes/no, theme names or the indices indicated on the table itself.

UPDATES?
I don't see myself updating this anytime soon. Although it has a lot of things to improve I am focusing on other things'
